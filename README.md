About me 🐱‍👤

Junior Backend Developer

- I'm interested in AI and Machine Lerning so I'm currently learning Python.
- I've worked in a few projects so far so I have experience in backend and fronted development.
- I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that might need help in HTML, Python, JavaScript or PHP.
- I'm an eager programmer so I'll always do my best in any project I work in.
